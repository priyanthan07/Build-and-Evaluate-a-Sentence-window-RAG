topics in theoretical and\\ncomputational linguistics with hands-on practical experience of using existing\\nsoftware tools and developing applications to process texts and access linguistic\\nresources. The aims of the course and learning outcomes are listed in Chapter 1.\\nThis course has no speciﬁc prerequisites. There will be some programming involved\\nand you will need to acquire some familiarity with the Python language, but you will\\nnot be expected to develop substantial original code or to encode specialised\\nalgorithms. The course involves some statistical techniques, but the only\\nmathematical knowledge assumed is an understanding of elementary probability\\nand familiarity with the concept of logarithms.\\nBefore the advent of the world wide web, most machine-readable information was\\nstored in structured databases and accessed via specialised query languages such as\\nStructured Query Language (SQL). Nowadays the situation is reversed: most\\ninformation is found in unstructured or semi-structured natural language documents\\nand there is increasing demand for techniques to ‘unlock’ this data. Computing\\ngraduates with knowledge of natural language processing techniques are ﬁnding\\nemployment in areas such as text analytics, sentiment analysis, topic detection and\\ninformation extraction.\\nAssessment\\nThe course is assessed via an unseen written examination. A sample examination\\npaper is provided in the Appendix at the end of this subject guide, with some\\nguidelines on how to answer the questions. You will be required to attempt three\\nquestions out of a choice of ﬁve. The questions will cover ‘book knowledge’, problem\\nsolving and short essays on more theoretical topics. The examination is not a\\nmemory test but will be designed to assess your understanding of the course\\ncontent. There will also be coursework which will include a similar mix of questions,\\nbut with a stronger focus on practical problem-solving.\\nYou will be expected to provide electronic copies of your coursework for plagiarism\\nchecking purposes. It is very important that any material that is not original to you\\nshould be properly attributed and placed in quotation marks, with a full list of\\nreferences at the end of your submission. You should follow the style used in this\\nsubject guide for citing references, for example:\\nSegaran (2007, pp.117–118) discusses some problems with rule-based spam ﬁlters.\\nAnswers which consist entirely or mostly of quoted material are unlikely to get many\\nmarks even if properly attributed, as simply reproducing an answer in someone\\nelse’s words does not demonstrate that you have fully understood the material.\\nIn order to give you some practice in problem-solving and writing short essays, there\\n1\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nare a number of Activities throughout this subject guide. The Appendix includes a\\nsection ‘Answers to selected activities’, although these will not always provide\\ncomplete answers to the questions but are intended to indicate how particular types\\nof questions should be approached. Sample examination questions are provided at\\nthe end of each chapter. Some, but not all, of these are included in the sample\\nexamination paper with suggested answers at the end of the guide.\\nThe subject guide and other learning resources\\nThis subject guide is not intended as a self-contained textbook but sets out speciﬁc\\ntopics for study in the CO3354 half unit. There is a recommended textbook and a\\nnumber of other readings are listed at appropriate places. There are also links to\\nwebsites providing useful resources such as software tools and access to online\\nlinguistic data. The learning outcomes listed in the next chapter assume that you are\\nworking through the recommended readings, activities and sample examination\\nquestions.

Since the start of the\\ntwenty-ﬁrst century this vision has been starting to look more plausible: artiﬁcial\\nintelligence techniques allied with the scientiﬁc study of language have emerged\\nfrom universities and research laboratories to inform a variety of industrial and\\ncommercial applications. Many websites now offer automatic translation; mobile\\nphones can appear to understand spoken questions and commands; search engines\\nlike Google use basic linguistic techniques for automatically completing or\\n‘correcting’ your queries and for ﬁnding relevant results that are closely matched to\\nyour search terms. We are still some way from full machine understanding of natural\\nlanguage, however. Automated translations still need to be reviewed and edited by\\nskilled human translators while no computer system has yet come close to passing\\nthe ‘Turing Test’ of convincingly simulating human conversation. Indeed it has been\\nargued that the Turing Test is a blind alley and that research should focus on\\nproducing effective applications for speciﬁc requirements without seeking to\\ngenerate an illusion that users are interacting with a human rather than a machine\\n(Hayes and Ford, 1995). Hopefully, by the time you ﬁnish this course you will have\\ncome to appreciate some of the challenges posed by full understanding of natural\\nlanguage as well as the very real achievements that have resulted from focusing on a\\nrange of speciﬁc, well-deﬁned tasks.\\n1.2 Aims of the course\\nThis course combines a critical introduction to key topics in theoretical linguistics\\nwith hands-on practical experience of developing applications to process texts and\\naccess linguistic resources. The main topics covered are:\\naccessing text corpora and lexical resources\\nprocessing raw text\\ncategorising and tagging\\nextracting information from text\\nanalysing sentence structure.\\n5\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n1.3 Learning outcomes\\nOn successful completion of this course, including recommended readings, exercises\\nand activities, you should be able to:\\n1. utilise and explain the function of software tools such as corpus readers,\\nstemmers, taggers and parsers\\n2. explain the difference between regular and context-free grammars and deﬁne\\nformal grammars for fragments of a natural language\\n3. critically appraise existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such\\nas chatbots and translation systems\\n4. describe some applications of statistical techniques to natural language analysis,\\nsuch as classiﬁcation and probabilistic parsing.\\nEach main chapter contains a list of learning outcomes speciﬁc to that chapter at the\\nbeginning, as well as a summary at the end of the chapter.\\n1.4 Reading list and other learning resources\\nThis is a list of textbooks and other resources which will be useful for all or most\\nparts of the course.

These learning outcomes are\\nlisted at the beginning of each main chapter and assume that you have worked\\nthrough the recommended readings and activities for that chapter.\\n1.6.1 Chapter 2: Introducing NLP: patterns and structures in language\\nThis chapter looks at different approaches to analysing texts, ranging from ‘shallow’\\ntechniques that focus on individual words and phrases to ‘deeper’ methods that\\nproduce a full representation of the grammatical structure of a sentence as a\\nhierarchical tree diagram. The chapter introduces two important formalisms:\\nregular expressions , which will play an important part throughout the course, and\\ncontext-free grammars which we return to in Chapter 6 of the subject guide.\\n1.6.2 Chapter 3: Getting to grips with natural language data\\nThis chapter looks at the different kinds of data resources that can be used for\\ndeveloping tools to harvest information that has been published as machine-readable\\ndocuments. In particular, we introduce the notion of a ‘corpus’ (plural corpora ) – for\\nthe purposes of this course, a computer-readable collection of text or speech. The\\nNLTK includes a selection of excerpts from several well-known corpora and we\\nprovide brief descriptions of the most important of these and of the different formats\\nin which corpora are stored.\\n8\\n\\nWhat the course does not cover\\n1.6.3 Chapter 4: Computational tools for text analysis\\nThe previous chapter introduced some relatively superﬁcial techniques for language\\nanalysis such as concordancing and collocations. This chapter covers some\\nfundamental operations in text analysis:\\ntokenisation: breaking up a character string into words, punctuation marks and\\nother meaningful expressions;\\nstemming: removing afﬁxes from words, e.g. mean+ing ,distribut+ion ;\\ntagging: associating each word in a text with a grammatical category or part of\\nspeech.\\n1.6.4 Chapter 5: Statistically-based techniques for text analysis\\nStatistical and probabilistic methods are pervasive in modern computational\\nlinguistics. These methods generally do not aim at complete understanding or\\nanalysis of a text, but at producing reliable answers to well-deﬁned problems such as\\nsentiment analysis, topic detection or recognising named entities and relations\\nbetween them in a text.\\n1.6.5 Chapter 6: Analysing sentences: syntax and parsing\\nThis chapter resumes the discussion of natural language syntax that was introduced\\nin Chapter 2, concentrating on context-free grammar formalisms and various ways\\nthey need to be modiﬁed and extended beyond the model that was presented in that\\nchapter. Formal grammars do not encode any kind of processing strategy but simply\\nprovide a declarative speciﬁcation of the well-formed sentences in a language.\\nParsers are computer programs that use grammar rules to analyse sentences, and\\nthis chapter introduces some fundamental approaches to syntactic parsing.\\n1.6.6 Appendices\\nThe Appendices include:\\nA. A bibliography listing all works referenced in the subject guide, including\\npublication details and ISBNs.\\nB. A glossary of technical terms used in this subject guide.\\nC. Answers to selected activities.\\nD. A trace of a recursive descent parse as described in Chapter 6 of the subject guide.\\nE. A sample examination paper with guidelines on how to answer questions.\\n1.7 What the course does not cover\\nThe ﬁeld of natural language processing or computational linguistics is a large and\\ndiverse one, and includes many topics we will not be able to address in this course.\\nSome of these are listed below:\\n9\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nspeech recognition and synthesis\\ndialogue and question answering\\nmachine translation\\nsemantic analysis, including word meanings and logical structure\\ngenerating text or speech from non-linguistic inputs.\\nHowever, the course should provide you with a basis for investigating some of these\\nareas for your ﬁnal year project. Some of these topics are dealt with in the later\\nchapters of Bird et al. (2009) and most of them are touched on by Jurafsky and\\nMartin (2009).\\n10\\n\\nChapter 2\\nIntroducing NLP: patterns and structure in\\nlanguage\\nEssential reading\\nSteven Pinker (2007), The Language Instinct , Chapter 4.\\nRecommended reading\\nJurafsky and Martin (2009), Speech and Language Processing second edition,\\nChapters/Sections 2 ‘Regular Expressions and Automata’, 5.1 ‘(Mostly) English Word\\nClasses’, 12.1 ‘Constituency’, 12.2 ‘Context-Free Grammars’, 12.3 ‘Some Grammar\\nRules for English’.\\nAdditional reading\\nThe Internet Grammar of English;\\nhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/home.htm especially sections ‘Word\\nClasses’ and ‘Introducing Phrases’.\\nPartee, ter Meulen and Wall, (1990), Mathematical Methods in Linguistics ,\\nChapters/Sections 16.1–4, 17.1–3 (omitting 17.1.2–5, 17.2.1), 18.2, 18.6.\\n2.1 Learning outcomes\\nBy the end of this chapter, and having completed the Essential reading and activities,\\nyou should be able to:\\nexplain the concept of ﬁnite state machines (FSMs) and their connections with\\nregular expressions; work through simple FSMs\\nwrite regular expressions for well-deﬁned patterns of symbols\\nanalyse sentences in terms of parts of speech (POS) and constituent structure,\\nincluding the use of tree diagrams\\nwrite regular and context-free grammars for small fragments of natural language\\nexplain the concept of stemming and specify word-formation rules for given\\nexamples.\\n11\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n2.2 Introduction\\nPeople communicate in many different ways: through speaking and listening,\\nmaking gestures, using specialised hand signals (such as when driving or directing\\ntrafﬁc), using sign languages for the deaf, or through various forms of text.\\nBy text we mean words that are written or printed on a ﬂat surface (paper, card,\\nstreet signs and so on) or displayed on a screen or electronic device in order to be\\nread by their intended recipient (or by whoever happens to be passing by).\\nThis course will focus only on the last of these: we will be concerned with various\\nways in which computer systems can analyse and interpret texts, and we will assume\\nfor convenience that these texts are presented in an electronic format. This is of\\ncourse quite a reasonable assumption, given the huge amount of text we can access\\nvia the World Wide Web and the increasing availability of electronic versions of\\nnewspapers, novels, textbooks and indeed subject guides. This chapter introduces\\nsome essential concepts, techniques and terminology that will be applied in the rest\\nof the course. Some material in this chapter is a little technical but no programming\\nis involved at this stage.\\nWe will begin in section 2.3 by considering texts as strings of characters which can\\nbe broken up into sub-strings, and introduce some techniques for informally\\ndescribing patterns of various kinds that occur in texts. Subsequently in section 2.4\\nwe will begin to motivate the analysis of texts in terms of hierarchical structures in\\nwhich elements of various kinds can be embedded within each other, in a\\ncomparable way to the elements that make up an HTML web document. This section\\nintroduces some technical machinery such as: ﬁnite-state machines (FSMs), regular\\nexpressions, regular grammars and context-free grammars.\\n2.3 Basic concepts\\n2.3.1 Tokenised text and pattern matching\\nOne of the more basic operations that can be applied to a text is tokenising :\\nbreaking up a stream of characters into words, punctuation marks, numbers and\\nother discrete items. So for example the character string\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes”, said Stamford, introducing us.\\ncan be tokenised as in the following example, where each token is enclosed in single\\nquotation marks:\\n`\"\\' `Dr.\\' `Watson\\' `,\\' `Mr.\\' `Sherlock\\' `Holmes\\' `\"\\' `,\\'\\n`said\\' `Stamford\\' `,\\' `introducing\\' `us\\' `.\\'\\nAt this level, words have not been classiﬁed into grammatical categories and we\\nhave very little indication of syntactic structure. Still, a fair amount of information\\nmay be obtained from relatively shallow analysis of tokenised text. For example,\\nsuppose we want to develop a procedure for ﬁnding all personal names in a given\\ntext. We know that personal names always start with capital letters, but that is not\\nenough to distinguish them from names of countries, cities, companies, racehorses\\n12\\n\\nBasic concepts\\nand so on, or from capitalisation at the start of a sentence. Some additional ways to\\nidentify personal names include:\\nUse of a title Dr.,Mr.,Mrs.,Miss,Professor and so on.\\nA capitalised word or words followed by a comma and a number, usually below\\n100: this is a common way of referring to people in news reports, where the\\nnumber stands for their age – for example Pierre Vinken, 61, . . .\\nA capitalised word followed by a verb that usually applies to humans: said,\\nreported ,claimed ,thought ,argued . . . This can over-generate in the case of\\ncountry or organisation names as in the Crown argues orBritain claimed .\\nWe can express these more concisely as follows, where jis the disjunction symbol,\\nWord stands for a capitalised word and Intis an integer:\\n(Dr.jProfessorjMr.jMrs.jMissjMs)Word\\nWord Word ,Int\\nWord (saidjthoughtjbelievedjclaimedjarguedj...)\\nLearning activity\\n1. Write down your own examples of names that match each of the above patterns.\\n2. Pick a newspaper article or webpage that provides a variety of examples of people’s names. Do they\\nmatch the patterns we have encoded above? If not, see if you can devise additional rules for\\nrecognising names and write them out in a similar format.\\n2.3.2 Parts of speech\\nA further stage in analysing text is to associate every token with a grammatical\\ncategory or part of speech (POS). A number of different POS classiﬁcations have\\nbeen developed within computational linguistics and we will see some examples in\\nsubsequent chapters. The following is a list of categories that are often encountered\\nin general linguistics: you will be familiar with many of them already from learning\\nthe grammar of English or other languages, though some terms such as Determiner\\norConjunction may be new to you.\\nNoun ﬁsh, book, house, pen, procrastination, language\\nProper noun John, France, Barack, Goldsmiths, Python\\nVerb loves, hates, studies, sleeps, thinks, is, has\\nAdjective grumpy, sleepy, happy, bashful\\nAdverb slowly, quickly, now, here, there\\nPronoun I, you, he, she, we, us, it, they\\nPreposition in, on, at, by, around, with, without\\nConjunction and, but, or, unless\\nDeterminer the, a, an, some, many, few, 100\\n13\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nBird et al. (2009, pp. 184–5) make the standard distinction that nouns ‘generally\\nrefer to people, places, things or concepts’ while verbs ‘describe events or actions’.\\nThis may be helpful when one is starting to learn grammatical terminology but is\\nsomething of an over-simpliﬁcation. One can easily ﬁnd or construct examples\\nwhere the same concept can be expressed by a noun or a verb, or by an adjective or\\nan adverb. And on the other hand, there are many words that can take different\\nparts of speech depending on what they do in a sentence:\\n1. Rome fell swiftly .\\n2. The fallof Rome was swift.\\n3. The enemy completely destroyed the city.\\n4. The enemy’s destruction of the city was complete .\\n5. John likes to ﬁshon the river bank.\\n6. John caught a ﬁsh.\\nAdditionally, some types of verbs do not correspond to any particular action but\\nserve a purely grammatical function: these include the auxiliary verbs such as did,\\nshall and so on. So in summary, we can often only assign a part of speech to a word\\ndepending on its function in context rather than how it relates to real things or\\nevents in the world.\\nLearning activity\\nIdentify parts of speech in these examples:\\n1. The cat sat on the mat.\\n2. John sat on the chair.\\n3. The dog saw the rabbit.\\n4. Jack and Jill went up the hill.\\n5. The owl and the pussycat went to sea.\\n6. The train travelled slowly.\\n2.3.3 Constituent structure\\nYou will have noticed several recurring patterns in the above examples: Det Noun ,\\nPrep Det Noun and so on. You may also have noticed that some types of phrase can\\noccur in similar contexts: (Johnjthe cat) sat , aProper Noun or a sequence Det Noun\\ncan come before a Verb. Some of these possibilities can be captured using the\\npattern-matching notation introduced above, for example:\\n(((theja)(catjdog))(JohnjJackjSusan))(barkedjslept)\\nThis will match any sequence which ends in a verb barked orslept preceded by\\neither a Determiner aorthefollowed by a Noun catordogora proper name John,\\nJack orSusan .\\nPatterns that have similar distributions (meaning that they can occur in similar\\ncontexts) are standardly identiﬁed by phrasal categories such as Noun Phrase orVerb\\n14\\n\\nA closer look at syntax\\nPhrase . A common way to represent information about constituent structure is by\\nmeans of production rules of the form X!A;B;C::: . Using rules of this form,\\ngrammatical sentences can be broken down into constituent phrases consisting of\\nvarious combinations of POS:\\nSentence!Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase\\nNoun Phrase!Determiner, Noun ( Example: the, dog)\\nNoun Phrase!Proper Noun ( Example: Jack)\\nNoun Phrase!Noun Phrase, Conj, Noun Phrase ( Examples: Jack and Jill, the owl and the pussycat)\\nVerb Phrase!Verb, Noun Phrase ( Example: saw the rabbit)\\nVerb Phrase!Verb, Preposition, Noun Phrase ( Examples: went up the hill, sat on the mat)\\nLearning activity\\nRead through the recommended sections of the UCL ‘Internet Grammar of English’. Write production rules\\nthat cover some of the examples in these sections.\\n2.4 A closer look at syntax\\nThis section aims to motivate the idea that texts can be analysed as hierarchical\\nstructures rather than ‘ﬂat’ sequences whose elements are organised in various\\npatterns. The Essential reading for this chapter by Steven Pinker gives a concise and\\naccessible introduction to some fundamental distinctions we will make in this\\nsection, from the point of view of Chomskyan linguistics (compare Chomsky,\\n1957/2002). Chomsky and his followers argue that some components of our\\nknowledge of language are innate, and Pinker (2007, chapter 4) sketches some\\narguments in support of this claim. This position is considered to be contentious by\\nmany linguists and we will not address it in this course. However, Pinker’s chapter\\nprovides a useful introduction to syntactic analysis and clearly distinguishes between\\ntwo formal techniques for modelling grammatical knowledge, which underlie\\nregular andcontext-free grammars respectively (these terms will be explained as\\nwe go along).\\nLearning activity\\nIf you have access to it, read through the recommended chapter by Pinker and make notes, and have it to\\nhand while working through the remainder of this section.\\nPinker notes that language makes ‘inﬁnite use of ﬁnite means’, in Humboldt’s\\nphrase1. That is, there is no principled upper limit to the length of a grammatical\\nsentence: we can always add another phrase, even if it’s a banal one like ‘one could\\nsay that’, ‘and that’s a fact’ or ‘and you can tell that to the Marines’. A large\\n1‘Sie [die Sprache] muss daher von endlichen Mitteln einen unendlichen Gebrauch machen’ (von Hum-\\nboldt, 1836, p. 122).\\n15\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nproportion, perhaps most of the sentences we read, hear or speak every day may be\\nentirely novel, at least to us. Consequently, knowledge of a language seems to\\nconsist in knowing rules that specify what sentences belong to the language, rather\\nthan memorising long lists of sentences to be produced on appropriate occasions.\\nPinker considers two different formal systems for generating or recognising\\nsentences in English:\\n‘wordchain’ devices, equivalent to ﬁnite state machines. These devices\\nincorporate three distinct operations: sequence ,selection anditeration .\\nPhrase structure grammars, which include the additional operation of recursion .\\nNote that Pinker deliberately uses the more descriptive expression ‘wordchain’ as he\\nis concerned to avoid the use of forbidding technical terminology. In what follows\\nwe will stick to the standard term ﬁnite-state machine which you are more likely to\\nﬁnd in textbooks. You may also encounter the terms ﬁnite-state automaton or just\\nﬁnite automaton .\\n2.4.1 Operation of a ﬁnite-state machine\\nA wordchain device or ﬁnite-state machine (FSM) can be seen as a set of lists of\\nsymbols (such as words or ﬁxed phrases) and rules for going from list to list. A\\nsimple example:\\nWord lists\\n1. The, a, one\\n2. Cat, dog, ﬁsh\\n3. Barked, slept, swam\\nRules\\nIt is important to keep in mind that FSMs are neutral between accepting and\\ngenerating strings. That is to say, one way to operate a FSM is to read a string, one\\nsymbol at a time, and determine whether the symbol is found in the list at the\\ncurrent state of the machine. If it is, we advance to the next state and read the next\\nsymbol. Alternatively, this FSM could be used to generate strings by picking one\\nword from each list in sequence. Some possible matching strings are:\\nThe dog swam\\nA cat barked\\nA ﬁsh slept\\n. . .\\nA more complex example:\\n1.John/Mary/Fred OR\\n1a.the/a/one\\n1b.cat/dog/ﬁsh\\n16\\n\\nA closer look at syntax\\n2.

(optional) and/or/but GO TO 1 .\\nThis formulation involves the basic operations of sequence, selection and iteration as\\nfollows:\\nSEQUENCE\\nMoving from list to list in numerical order: 1, 2, 3 . . .\\nSELECTION\\nChoosing an item from a list, for example cat,dogorﬁsh; choosing between lists.\\nITERATION\\nRepeating particular sequences, for example:\\nJohn and Mary or a ﬁsh (repeats step 1.)\\nThe cat barked but Fred walked on the hill. (Repeats steps 1–5, omitting step 4.)\\nLearning activity\\n1. Find the shortest sentence generated or accepted by the above FSM.\\n2. Write out four sentences between six and 20 words long which are accepted by the FSM.\\n2.4.2 Representing ﬁnite-state machines\\nThere are various conventional ways of representing a non-deterministic FSM in\\nterms of a number of states and the permissible transitions between states. In our\\ninformal exposition above, the numbered steps represent states and each symbol or\\nword in a list counts as a possible transition to the next state. Pinker adopts a\\ngraphical convention where states are depicted as nodes in a graph and transitions\\nare directed, labelled arcs between the nodes; see also Partee et al. (1990, p. 457\\nand following). Alternatively, the states and transitions can be shown in tabular form\\nas in Table 2.1 where q1is the initial state and q4the ﬁnal state:\\n17\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nq1 john q2\\nq1 mary q2\\nq1 the q1a\\nq1 a q1a\\nq1a cat q2\\nq1a dog q2\\nq2 slept q3\\nq2 barked q3\\nq2 swam q3\\nq3 and q1\\nq3 or q1\\nq3 . q4\\nTable 2.1: A ﬁnite-state machine represented as a state-transition table.\\n2.4.3 Declarative alternatives to ﬁnite-state machines\\nThe FSMs shown above combine a formal speciﬁcation of a language with a\\nprocessing strategy. It is often convenient to separate the two and deﬁne the\\nlanguage using expressions from a declarative formalism which can be manipulated\\nusing various different algorithms. This section considers two such formalisms:\\nregular expressions andregular grammars .\\nRegular expressions (REs) provide a simple but powerful means of identifying\\npatterns in text and are widely used in various applications of computer science. REs\\nare based on three fundamental concepts which as we have seen are characteristic of\\nﬁnite-state machines:\\nsequence – to do with the order in which items occur: may include a wildcard\\ncharacter which is written as the period or full stop ‘.’ and may be replaced by\\nany character.\\nselection – specifying a choice between alternative items or sequences, indicated by\\nthe ‘j’ operator\\niteration – repetition of items or sequences, indicated by the ‘*’ operator, meaning\\nzero or more occurrences of whatever precedes the star.\\nSome simple examples:\\na*matches sequences of zero or more a’s:a,aaaa ,aaaaaaaaaaa and so on.

(2009, Table 3.3) and the other recommended readings on this\\ntopic.\\nHere are some examples of our suggested ways of recognising personal names coded\\nas regular expressions. These are intended to be applied to tokenised text and every\\nsequence enclosed by angled brackets <:::> stands for an individual token. In\\nExamples 1, 3 and 4 below, the material within parentheses represents the target\\nstring and sequences outside parentheses provide the context.\\n1.<Mrs?>(<.+>) matches ‘Mr’ or ‘Mrs’ followed by any string. The ﬁrst token\\nconsists of the sequence Mrfollowed optionally by the character s. The second\\nconsists of a sequence of one or more characters: any character may occur in\\nplace of the wildcard ‘.’.\\n2.<[A-Z][a-z]+ >+ matches any sequence of one or more capitalised words.\\n3. (<[A-Z][a-z]+ >+)<,><[0-9]+>matches capitalised word(s) followed by a\\ncomma and a number (age).\\n4. (<[A-Z][a-z]+ >+)<saidjreportedjclaimed>.\\nLearning activity\\n1.

Write a regular expression for all strings that contain abba somewhere within them.\\nAs you have probably observed, the pattern-matching notation we used in section\\n2.3 employed a subset of the RE syntax, and we could in principle use regular\\nexpressions to encode simple grammars as presented in that section. For example:\\n( (JohnjMaryjFred)j( (theja)(catjdogjﬁsh) )\\n(barkedjsleptjswam)\\n((andjor) (barkedjsleptjswam))*\\nmatches sentences like:\\n1. John slept\\n2. The cat barked or swam\\n3.

The procedure is apparently designed to deal with complex sentences\\nincluding constructions like If. . . then. . . andEither. . . or . . . . If we look at a few\\npossible matching strings, we see clearly that some are grammatical sentences but\\nothers are nonsensical. (Following a standard convention in linguistics, the\\nunacceptable cases are marked with an asterisk ‘*’.)\\nEither a happy girl eats ice cream or the boy eats hot dogs.\\n*Either a happy girl eats ice cream then one dog eats candy.\\nIf a girl eats ice cream then the boy eats candy.\\n*If a girl eats ice cream or the boy eats candy.\\nLearning activity\\n1. Write a regular grammar that is equivalent to the FSM in Pinker (2007, p. 86).\\n2. Convince yourself that it allows you to draw well-formed trees for the ungrammatical examples above.\\n3. What characteristic of the grammar prevents it from ruling out the ill-formed examples?\\nSee ‘Answers to Activities’ in Appendix C (p. 98) for further discussion.\\nIn order to handle these kinds of sentences correctly we need to add new kinds of\\nrewrite rules, going beyond the class of right- or left-linear grammars:\\n1. To match pairs of words like if . . . then ,either . . . or , we need rules where a\\nnon-terminal symbol on the RHS can have additional material on both sides as\\nin the ﬁrst two rules below.\\n2. In order to allow for indeﬁnite nesting – if either John will come if Mary does, or\\n. . .we need rules where the same symbol can occur on both sides of the arrow.\\nThis is known as self-embedding orcentre-embedding .\\nNote that centre-embedding is an instance of recursion in grammar; right-linear\\ngrammars may also include recursive rules but they can always be processed\\niteratively rather than recursively (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009, p. 447).\\n21\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nS!Either S or S\\nS!If S then S\\nS!NP VP\\nNP!Det N\\nDet!ajthej\\x0f\\nN!girljboyjdogjcatjburgersjcandyjcreamjcake\\nVP!V NP\\nVP!V PP\\nPP!P NP\\nV!eatsjlikesjsat\\nP!on\\nThe above grammar handles these cases correctly as well as simple sentences like\\nThe cat sat on the mat :\\nS\\nNP\\nDet\\ntheN\\ncatVP\\nV\\nsatPP\\nP\\nonNP\\nDet\\ntheN\\nmat\\nFigure 2.2: Tree diagram for The cat sat on the mat.\\nIt is also acceptable to represent trees using labelled bracketed strings as in the\\nexample below:\\n(S\\n(NP (Det the ) (N cat ))\\n(VP (V sat )\\n(PP\\n(P on )\\n(NP\\n(Det the ) (N mat ) )\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n22\\n\\nA closer look at syntax\\nFigure 2.3 is an example of self-embedding.\\nS\\nIf S\\nNP\\nDet\\ntheN\\ncatVP\\nV\\nlikesNP\\nDet\\n\\x0fN\\ncreamthen S\\nNP\\nDet\\ntheN\\nboyVP\\nV\\neatsNP\\nDet\\n\\x0fN\\nburgers\\nFigure 2.3: Tree diagram with self-embedding.\\nLearning activity\\n1.

Think of ways to modify the grammar to generate more natural-sounding sentences.\\n2.4.5 Looking ahead: some further uses of regular expressions\\nIn this chapter we have so far looked at ﬁnite-state formalisms as techniques for\\ngenerating or recognising short phrases as well as whole sentences, and found them\\nto be wanting. Many current applications in language technology do not, in fact,\\nrequire complete analysis of sentences but proceed by looking for patterns of interest\\nwithin a text and discarding what does not match these patterns. Finite-state\\nmethods are often quite adequate for these applications and you will see many uses\\nfor regular expressions in later chapters of this guide. Some examples we will look at\\nin more detail in later chapters are:\\nstemming: extracting the ‘base form’ of a word as informally presented in\\nsection 2.5 of this chapter\\ntagging: automatically assigning POS or other forms of mark-up to elements in a\\ntext\\nchunking: grouping together a sequence of words as a phrase\\ninformation extraction: identifying chunks that denote meaningful entities,\\nevents or other items of interest.\\n23\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n2.4.6 Looking ahead: grammars and parsing\\nThe pseudocode and graphical representations of wordchains (FSMs) combine a\\nspeciﬁcation of the well-formed sentences in a language fragment with a processing\\nstrategy. It is important to keep in mind that formal grammars made up of a series of\\nproduction rules do notencode a processing strategy. As stated above, a grammar is\\na declarative speciﬁcation of the strings that make up a language while parsers use a\\nvariety of algorithms to apply the grammar rules. We will look at some of these\\nparsing strategies in Chapter 6 of this subject guide.\\n2.5 Word structure\\nWords combine in different orders to form sentences and phrases; they also have\\ninternal structure. Nouns in English may have different endings according to\\nwhether they are singular ( a box ) or plural ( some boxes ) while in some languages\\nthis information may be expressed at the start of the word, for example Swahili ziwa\\n(‘lake’) vs maziwa (‘lakes’). In English, endings of verbs can indicate person, number,\\ntense and mood2, while other languages may make different dictinctions. Nouns and\\nverbs are sometimes classiﬁed as regular or irregular according to whether their\\ninﬂected forms can be derived by following simple rules. Table 2.2 shows examples\\nof some common past tense forms in English.\\nPresent Past\\nbecome became\\ncome came\\nmistake mistook\\nmisunderstand misunderstood\\nring rang\\nsell sold\\nshake shook\\nsing sang\\nsink sank\\nstand stood\\ntake took\\ntell told\\ntravel travelled\\nunderstand understood\\nwithstand withstood\\nTable 2.2: Past tense forms (1).\\nThe subﬁeld of linguistics known as morphology is concerned with the structure of\\nwords and is concerned, among other things, with formulating rules for deriving\\ndifferent forms of a word according to its grammatical role. Here are some rules\\nwhich appear to cover the examples in the table:\\n2See the Internet Grammar of English at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/verbs/verbs.htm (last\\nvisited 27th May 2013) for explanations of these terms.\\n24\\n\\nA brief history of natural language processing\\nSome rules for past-tense formation\\n-come!-came\\n-take!-took\\n-ing!-ang\\n-ink!-ank\\n-ell!-old\\n-and!-ood\\n-el!-elled\\nSome of these rules could be made more general: we could combine the -ingand\\n-inkrules to a single rule, -in !-an. On the other hand, some rules which work for\\nthese particular examples would fail if applied to a wider range of data: we have\\ncome!came ,become!became but not welcome!*welcame . This is an example of\\nrules overﬁtting the data.\\nLearning activity\\nModify the above rules so that they will account for the past tense forms in Table 2.3 as well as in Table 2.2.\\nPresent Past\\nbake baked\\ncommand commanded\\nbring brought\\nsling slung\\nsmell smelt\\nthink thought\\nwake woke\\nTable 2.3: Past tense forms (2).\\nA natural language application such as a machine translation system will typically\\ninclude a database of words or lexicon along with rules for deriving word endings:\\nfor example, a translation from English into Dutch might handle the word brought as\\nfollows:\\n1. Find the stem of brought and interpret the inﬂection: bring +past\\n2. Find the Dutch equivalent of bring :brengen\\n3. Find the past tense of brengen :bracht\\nThe process of removing afﬁxes from words to derive the basic form is called\\nstemming . We will look at some tools for doing this in Chapter 4, and you will also\\nhave the opportunity to encode your own rules as regular expressions.\\n2.6 A brief history of natural language processing\\nThe ﬁeld of natural language processing or computational linguistics builds on\\ntechniques and insights from a number of different disciplines, principally\\n25\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\ntheoretical linguistics and computer science but with some input from mathematical\\nlogic and psychology.\\nThe notions of a ﬁnite-state machine and context-free grammar (CFG) were ﬁrst\\nintroduced to linguistics by Chomsky (1957; see Pullum (2011) for a somewhat\\ncritical reappraisal). Chomsky argued that both formalisms were inadequate for\\nmodelling natural language and proposed an additional operation of\\ntransformations, which could essentially permute the output string of a CFG in\\nvarious ways. Chomsky’s work introduced a methodology which was to dominate\\ntheoretical linguistics for the next couple of decades: linguists concentrated on\\npostulating formal rules of grammar which were tested against their own intuitions\\nor those of native speakers of other languages, rather than seeking to induce rules\\nfrom large collections of data. Part of the rationale for this was that native speakers\\nof a language are able to recognise whether a sequence of words makes up an\\nacceptable sentence in their language, even if they have never encountered those\\nwords in that particular order before. Prior to what was to become known as the\\nChomskyan revolution, corpus-based approaches had been the norm in general\\nlinguistics. This tradition was overshadowed for a time by so-called ‘generative’\\nlinguistics, but corpus-based research continued in some quarters until its resurgence\\nin the 1980s, including the development of the ﬁrst machine-readable corpus by the\\nJesuit priest Fr Robert Busa. Busa developed a 10 million-word corpus of medieval\\nphilosophy on punch-cards, with the support of Thomas Watson of IBM (McEnery\\nand Wilson, 2001, pp. 20–21).\\nWork in formal grammar tended to assume a ‘backbone’ of context-free rules,\\naugmented with various mechanisms to handle data that appeared to go beyond the\\ncontext-free model; some important developments were Generalised Phrase\\nStructure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1985) and Head-driven Phrase Structure\\nGrammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994). We will see examples of these extra mechanisms\\nin Chapter 6.\\nEarly work on automated language processing was essentially procedural in its\\nmethodology, working with a type of ﬁnite-state machine called transition\\nnetworks which were extended as augmented transition networks to cope with\\nvarious linguistic constructions (Woods, 1970). Later work based on declarative\\ngrammar formalisms employed techniques including deductive parsing (Pereira and\\nWarren, 1983) and uniﬁcation (Kay, 1984). The former adopts techniques from the\\nAI ﬁeld of automated reasoning: the core idea is that parsing a sentence can be seen\\nas constructing a logical proof that a particular sequence of words forms a proper\\nsentence according to a given set of grammar rules. Uniﬁcation grammars treat\\nlinguistic objects as sets of attributes or features with a ﬁnite range of values, and\\ngrammar rules specify that particular items in a sentence must have the same or\\ncompatible values for certain features. For example, the subject and main verb of a\\nsentence should have the same value for the number feature. We will consider\\ndetailed examples in Chapter 6.\\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made in lower-level tasks such as speech\\nrecognition and morphological analysis using probabilistic techniques and\\nﬁnite-state models. During the late 1990s these techniques were extended to cover\\ntasks such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging and reference resolution (recognising\\nwhether or not different expressions in a document referred to the same person or\\nentity). These developments were driven by a number of factors: the continuing\\nincrease in the processing speed and memory capacity of computers; the availability\\nof massive amounts of spoken and written material, both in unstructured form on\\nthe world wide web and with various types of annotation in corpora such as the\\n26\\n\\nSample examination questions\\nPenn Treebank3or the British National Corpus4, and events such as the Message\\nUnderstanding Conferences5which were initially sponsored by the US Department\\nof Defense to measure and foster progress in extracting information from\\nunstructured text.\\nMuch work since around the year 2000 has involved the use of machine learning\\ntechniques such as Bayesian models and maximum entropy (see Chapter 5). This\\nhas involved using annotated corpora to train systems to segment and annotate texts\\naccording to various morphological, syntactic or semantic criteria. These techniques\\nhave been systematically applied to particular tasks such as parsing, word sense\\ndisambiguation, question answering and summarisation.\\n2.7 Summary\\n1. This chapter has characterised the subject matter of the course as being\\nconcerned with various ways of using computer programs to analyse text, by\\nwhich we mean words, numbers, punctuation and other meaningful symbols\\nthat are printed on paper or some other ﬂat surface, or displayed on a screen.\\n2. Some fundamental operations in text analysis include tokenisation , which\\ninvolves extracting these meaningful elements from a stream of electronic\\ncharacters and discarding white space, line feed characters and other material\\nwhich has no explicit meaning for a human reader, and using regular\\nexpressions to identify patterns in a text.\\n3. Regular expressions are composed of the three basic operations of sequence,\\nselection and iteration, and have many applications in computational linguistics\\nand computer science at large. A ﬁnite-state machine is a process whose\\noperations can be speciﬁed by means of regular expressions. A regular grammar\\nis a set of production rules or rewrite rules that deﬁnes the sentences that make\\nup a language, and any language deﬁned by a regular grammar can be\\nprocessed by a ﬁnite state machine or described using a regular expression.\\n4. A complete syntactic analysis of natural language sentences is generally held to\\nrequire the additional operation of centre-embedded recursion, which is beyond\\nthe power of ﬁnite-state methods. Recursion is formally encoded in context-free\\ngrammars.\\n5. Not only do words combine in various patterns and structures to form sentences;\\nthey also have internal structure which can be described to an extent using rules\\nfor regular and irregular forms.\\n6. The current state of NLP or computational linguistics builds on research results\\nand concepts from many different ﬁelds, and we have sketched some of the\\nhighlights in a very short history of the discipline.\\n2.8 Sample examination questions\\nYou can expect a list of RE operators to be included as an appendix in the\\nexamination paper.\\n3http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ \\x18treebank/; last visited 27th May 2013\\n4http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/; last visited 27th May 2013\\n5http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related projects/muc/; last visited 27th May 2013\\n27\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n1.

You should be familiar with these structures from previous programming\\ncourses, but should ensure you understand the way they are handled in Python. For\\nthis chapter, only lists are relevant and you should study Bird et al. (2009, section\\n1.2) before trying any of the learning activities in this chapter.\\n3.3 Corpora and other data resources\\nAs explained in the previous chapter, much natural language processing relies on\\nlarge collections of linguistic data known as corpora (plural of corpus ). A corpus can\\nbe simply deﬁned as no more than a collection of language data, composed of\\nwritten texts, transcriptions of speech or a combination of recorded speech and\\ntranscriptions.\\nCorpora fall into three broad categories (McEnery, 2003, p.450):\\nMonolingual corpora consist, as the name suggests, of data from a single\\nlanguage.\\nComparable corpora include a range of monolingual corpora in different\\nlanguages, preferably with a similar level of balance and representativeness, and\\ncan be used for contrastive studies of those languages.\\nParallel corpora include original texts in one language with translations of those\\ntexts in one or more different languages. Parallel corpora can be used to train\\nstatistical translation systems.\\nA corpus is generally expected to have additional characteristics: corpora are usually\\nconstructed so as to be balanced andrepresentative of a particular domain (McEnery\\nand Wilson, 2001, pp. 29–30). (Sometimes the term is used more loosely to cover\\nany large collection of language data which need not have been compiled\\nsystematically, as in the phrase ‘the web as corpus’.) Sampling theory is a branch of\\nstatistics that deals with questions such as: how many respondents are needed in an\\nopinion poll for the results to be considered to represent public opinion at large?\\nSimilar considerations arise in corpus linguistics. This is particularly important if a\\ncorpus is to be used for quantitative analysis of the kind described in Chapter 5: if\\nthe corpus data is skewed or unrepresentative then results of the analysis may not be\\nreliable. These considerations may be less important if the corpus is collected for the\\nliterary or historical interest of the documents that make it up, as is the case with\\nProject Gutenberg for example.\\nFor example, Bird et al. (2009, pp. 407–412) refer to the TIMIT corpus, an annotated\\nspeech corpus developed by Texas Instruments and MIT. To ensure\\nrepresentativeness, it was designed to include a wide coverage of dialect variations.\\nCorpus builders need to exercise expert judgment in deciding on the sampling frame ,\\n30\\n\\nSome uses of corpora\\nor ‘the entire population of texts from which we will take our samples’ (McEnery and\\nWilson, 2001, p. 78) and calculating the size of the corpus that is necessary for it to\\nbe maximally representative. The sampling frame may, for example, be bibliographic ,\\nbased on some comprehensive index or the holdings of a particular library, or\\ndemographic , selecting informants on the basis of various social categories as is often\\ndone in public opinion research.\\nCorpora have tended to be of a ﬁnite size and to remain ﬁxed once they have been\\ncompiled. There are also what is known as monitor corpora which are continually\\nupdated with new material. This is particularly useful for compilers of dictionaries\\nwho need to be able to track new words entering the language and the changing or\\ndeclining use of old ones. An example of a monitor corpus is the COBUILD Bank of\\nEnglishTM, which had around 300 million words when it was referred to by McEnery\\n(2003) and has since more than doubled in size to 650 million words.\\nA further distinction is between corpora consisting solely of the original or ‘raw’ text\\nand those that have been marked up with various annotations. One common\\ntechnique is standoff annotation where the mark-up is stored in a different ﬁle from\\nthe original text (McEnery and Wilson, 2001, p.38); (Bird et al., 2009, p.415).\\nFinally, corpora can be further classifed according to their structure:\\nIsolated – an unorganised collection of individual texts such as the Gutenberg\\nonline collection of literary works.\\nCategorised – texts are organised by categories such as genre; an example is the\\nBrown corpus described below.\\nOverlapping – some categories overlap. A news corpus such as Reuters may contain\\nstories which cover both politics and sport, for example.\\nTemporal – texts indicate language use over time. Examples are the Inaugural\\ncorpus of all inaugural speeches by US Presidents, and the Helsinki Diachronic\\ncorpus of about 1.6 million words of English dating from the early 9th century\\nCE to 1710.\\nSome examples of corpora, which will be described in more detail later in the\\nchapter, are:\\nBrown Developed at Brown University in the early 1960s.\\nBNC British National Corpus, created and managed by BNC consortium which\\nincludes Oxford and Lancaster universities, dictionary publishers OUP,\\nLongmans and Chambers, and the British Library.\\nCOBUILD (Bank of English) The Bank of EnglishTMforms part of the Collins\\nCorpus, developed by Collins Dictionaries and the University of Birmingham,\\nand contains 650 million words.\\nGutenberg An archive of free electronic books in various formats hosted at\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org /\\nPenn Treebank A corpus of reports from the Wall Street Journal and other sources\\nin various different formats.\\n3.4 Some uses of corpora\\nMcEnery and Wilson (2001, Chapter 4) discuss a variety of uses for corpora, some of\\nwhich are brieﬂy discussed below.\\n31\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n3.4.1 Lexicography\\nModern dictionaries such as Chambers, Collins and Longmans now rely heavily on\\ncorpus data in order to classify and inventorise the various ways words can be used\\nin contemporary English as well as any ways these uses may have changed. For\\nexample, a lexicographer who wishes to determine whether the words scapegoat ,\\nthermostat orleverage can be used as verbs can enter the appropriate search string\\nand be presented with examples such as the following (from the BNC):\\nScapegoating an individual prevents the debate and delays community\\nunderstanding .\\nThe measuring cell is immersed in a vat of liquid, usually benzene or xylene which\\ncan be thermostatted at temperatures between 273 and 400 K .\\nThese one-time costs once met could be leveraged over much more business activity\\naround the globe than we then enjoyed .\\nMcEnery and Wilson (2001, p. 107) discuss a case where they claim that two\\nwell-known dictionaries had ‘got it wrong’ by listing quake as a solely intransitive\\nverb, while examples in a transitive construction can in fact be found through a\\ncorpus search:\\nThese sudden movements quake the Earth. (BNC)\\nIt is perhaps debatable whether the dictionaries in question were ‘wrong’ to\\ndisregard examples like this, or the compilers may have judged this to be an\\nidiosyncratic usage which did not merit being included in a work of reference with\\nthe status of standard usage.\\n3.4.2 Grammar and syntax\\nLarge-scale grammars for pedagogic and reference use such as the Comprehensive\\nGrammar of the English Language (Quirk et al., 1985) or the Cambridge Grammar of\\nthe English Language (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) use corpora among their\\nsources of information along with results of linguistic research and the compilers’\\nown subjective intuitions as competent speakers of the language, although this has\\ntended to involve qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. Recent advances in\\ncomputational power and developments in parsed corpora and tools to analyse them\\nhave made it possible for researchers to carry out quantitative studies of various\\nkinds of grammatical frequency, such as the relative frequency of different clause\\ntypes in English. Other studies use corpora to test predictions made by formal\\ngrammars that have been developed within the generative school of linguistics. The\\nCOBUILD project which provided the resources for Collins English dictionaries has\\nalso resulted in a series of small handbooks covering various kinds of grammatical\\nconstruction, which are useful both for advanced language learners and for linguists\\nin search of examples.\\n3.4.3 Stylistics: variation across authors, periods, genres and channels of\\ncommunication\\nThe notion of style in communication is that people generally have a choice between\\ndifferent ways of expressing themselves and not only do individuals tend to make\\n32\\n\\nCorpora\\nsimilar choices each time they communicate, but their particular choices may be\\nmore characteristic of particular genres (romantic ﬁction, ﬁnancial news, court\\nreports and so on), time periods and channels of communication. By channels we\\nmean distinctions such as written text compared with spoken discourse, both of\\nwhich can be further subdivided: people will make different choices when\\ncomposing emails, sending text messages or (rarely) writing a letter by hand. We\\nprobably also adopt different styles when talking face-to-face and on the telephone.\\nLiterary scholars as well as law enforcement and intelligence agencies may have an\\ninterest in identifying the author of a document from internal evidence. There have\\nbeen various famous and less well-known instances of controversial attribution of\\nauthorship: for example, various ﬁgures have been put forward as the authors of\\nShakespeare’s plays.\\n3.4.4 Training and evaluation\\nIn addition to the applications listed above, corpora are routinely used in linguistic\\nresearch for training and testing machine-learning systems for speciﬁc tasks in text\\nanalytics such as:\\ndetecting the topic of a document\\nanalysing the sentiments expressed for or against some product or policy\\nidentifying individuals described in a text, relations between them and events\\nthey participate in\\nstatistical parsing\\nstatistical machine translation.\\nFor example, the Brown corpus and the WSJ corpus are typically used for evaluating\\ntext segmentation among other text processing tasks (Mikheev, 2003, p. 203).\\nThese topics will be covered in more detail in Chapter 5 of this subject guide, where\\nyou will be introduced to various machine-learning techniques. These will all be\\ntypes of supervised learning , where a system is trained on ‘corpora containing the\\ncorrect label for each input’ (Bird et al., 2009, p. 222), as opposed to unsupervised\\nlearning where the system is designed to detect patterns in the input without any\\nfeedback. This normally means that the corpus has been marked up by human\\nannotators. Standard practice is to divide a corpus into training and test sets; the\\ntest set is considered a gold standard for comparing the accuracy of trained learning\\nsystems with that of the annotators. Of course humans are fallible, and it is good\\npractice to use multiple annotators for at least a sample of the corpus and report the\\nlevel of inter-annotator agreement that was achieved. This will set an upper bound\\nfor the performance that can be expected from the system, as it seems meaningless\\nto say that a computer program can achieve 100 per cent accuracy on tasks where\\nhuman annotators disagree (see Jurafsky and Martin, 2009, p. 189).\\n3.5 Corpora\\nThis section provides brief descriptions of various corpora, some of which are\\ndistributed in full or in part with the NLTK and others can be accessed online.\\n33\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\n3.5.1 Brown corpus\\nThis was one of the ﬁrst ‘large-scale’ machine readable corpora, though it may seem\\nrather small by today’s standards, consisting of one million words. It was developed\\nat Brown University from the early 1960s and took around two decades to complete.\\nIt was intended as a ‘standard corpus of present-day edited American English’ and is\\ncaterorised by genre under headings such as:\\nNews Chicago Tribune : Society Reportage\\nEditorial Christian Science Monitor : Editorials\\nReviews Time Magazine : Reviews\\nGovernment US Ofﬁce of Civil Defense: The Family Fallout Shelter\\nScience Fiction Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land\\nHumour Thurber: The future, if any, of comedy .\\nThe Brown corpus is provided with the NLTK in tagged and untagged versions and\\ncan be accessed using the various methods listed by Bird et al. (2009, Table 2.3,\\np. 50).\\n3.5.2 British National Corpus\\nThe BNC is created and managed by the BNC consortium, which includes Oxford\\nand Lancaster universities, dictionary publishers OUP, Longmans and Chambers, and\\nthe British Library. It was developed between 1991 and 1994 and consists of 100\\nmillion words: 90 per cent written and 10 per cent transcriptions of speech. This\\nwas one of the ﬁrst corpora to include spontaneous spoken English. The corpus was\\nmarked up using an automated part-of-speech tagger which resulted in a signiﬁcant\\nsaving of time and expense compared with manual annotation by competent\\nspeakers of the language, but means that there is inevitably a degree of error – as\\nyou may discover in the course of the exercise given later in this chapter.\\nYou can access this corpus online and perform various kinds of analysis using the\\nSimple Query language. Registration is required via the following link but there is\\ncurrently no charge:\\nhttp://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/bncwebSignup/user/login.php (last visited 27th\\nMay 2013)\\n3.5.3 COBUILD Bank of English\\nThe COBUILD project involved Collins Dictionaries and the University of\\nBirmingham. The Collins corpus is a 2.5-billion word analytical database of English.\\nIt contains written material from websites, newspapers, magazines and books\\npublished around the world, and spoken material from radio, TV and everyday\\nconversations. The Bank of EnglishTMforms part of the Collins Corpus and contains\\n650 million words. It was used as a basis for the Collins Advanced Learner’s\\nDictionary, grammars and various tutorial materials for learners of English. It is not\\nincluded in the NLTK but there is limited online access via\\nhttp://www.collinslanguage.com/wordbanks .\\n34\\n\\nCorpora\\n3.5.4 Penn Treebank\\nThe Penn Treebank with its various offshoots is one of the widely used linguistic\\nresources among empirical researchers.\\nIt includes a collection of texts in four different formats:\\nRaw text (original).\\nTagged with POS using a tagset which was developed as part of the project.\\n‘Parsed’; that is, marked up with constituent structure.\\nCombined, including both POS tags and constituent structure.\\nThe Penn Treebank project . . . has produced treebanks from the Brown, Switchboard, ATIS and Wall Street\\nJournal corpora of English, as well as treebanks in Arabic and Chinese.\\nJurafsky and Martin (2009, p. 438)\\nThe project began at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1990s and the results\\nhave been used as a basis for further annotation efforts involving semantics and\\nrhetorical structure. The NLTK includes a selection from the Wall Street Journal\\n(WSJ) component of the Treebank, which can be accessed in each of the above\\nformats and additionally with a simpliﬁed POS tagset (Bird et al., 2009, Table 5-1,\\np. 183).

Chapters 4 and 5 of\\nthe subject guide will look at ways the analysis and interpretation itself can be\\nautomated to varying degrees.\\nConcordancing involves locating every instance of a word or phrase within a text or\\ncorpus and presenting it in context, usually a ﬁxed number of words before and\\nafter each occurrence.\\nCollocations are pairs of sequences of words that occur together in a text more\\nfrequently than would be expected by chance, and so provide a rough indication\\nof the content or style of a document.\\nConditional frequency distributions support an elementary form of statistical\\nanalysis. A frequency distribution counts observable events and a conditional\\nfrequency distribution pairs each event with a condition. Some sample\\napplications are:\\nComparing the use of particular words in different genres.\\nComparing word lengths in different languages.\\n3.6.1 Frequency distributions\\nThe following worked example displays some rudimentary stylistic analysis by\\nranking the POS tags in a corpus according to frequency.\\nCalculating tag frequency\\n1.

The\\ndocuments in these examples were sourced from UK government websites: you may ﬁnd similar\\ndocuments on the website of your own country’s government, or of transnational organisations like the\\nEuropean Union or the United Nations. Think of some terms which are likely to occur in several of these\\ndocuments and compare them using a conditional frequency distribution. If you can ﬁnd a lengthy report\\nwhich is issued along with a shorter summary, it is an interesting exercise to pick some key terms and see if\\ntheir comparative frequency is the same or similar in the original document and the summary.\\n3.7 Summary\\n1. A corpus is a collection of linguistic data which was not originally produced for\\nthe purposes of linguistic analysis. Properly speaking it should be constructed so\\nas to be balanced and representative. If a corpus includes any kind of\\n41\\n\\nCO3354 Introduction to natural language processing\\nannotation, it is good practice to use multiple annotators for at least a sample of\\nthe corpus and report the level of inter-annotator agreement that was\\nachieved.\\n2. Some uses of corpora include:\\nLexicography (compiling dictionaries).\\nCompiling grammars for education and reference purposes.\\nStylistics: developing techniques to identify the author or genre of a\\ndocument; investigating the effect on language use of different channels\\nsuch as email, chat, face-to-face conversation, telephone calls and\\nhand-written letters.\\nTraining and evaluation in linguistic research, using machine learning\\ntechniques.\\n3. This chapter includes brief descriptions of several well-known and widely-used\\ncorpora such as the Brown corpus, the BNC and the Penn Treebank.\\n4. Students on this course can access a variety of corpora through online interfaces\\nor by using corpus tools provided with the NLTK.\\n5. Some simple techniques for analysing corpora include concordancing,\\ncollocations and (conditional) frequency distributions. None of these techniques\\ninvolve automated linguistic analysis: the interpretation of the outputs is down\\nto the analyst.\\n3.8 Sample examination question\\na) Explain what is meant by the following types of corpus, and describe an example\\nin each category that you have encountered during this course:\\nisolated\\ncategorised\\noverlapping\\ntemporal.\\nb) What applications would a tagged andparsed corpus be suitable for?

Reference and description: both SF and RE use pronouns more than proper\\nnames; News has more proper names. Hard to interpret without further\\nanalysis: if an SF work includes a lot of dialogue for example, it might be more\\nnatural for characters to refer to each other as I, we, you and so on rather than\\nby name. And news stories tend to be about named individuals.\\n2. Syntactic complexity: we cannot be very precise with this data but it looks as if\\nthe SF genre has the least syntactic complexity and the RE genre the highest,\\njudging from the numbers of commas and conjunctions per sentence. Of course\\nwe cannot tell whether these tokens are connecting clauses or other types of\\nphrases.\\nIn an examination or coursework question, you would get credit for discussing these\\nand other characteristics in the light of your impressionistic understanding of the\\ntypical styles for these genres.\\n2.
