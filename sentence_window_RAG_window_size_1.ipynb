Recent advances in\\ncomputational power and developments in parsed corpora and tools to analyse them\\nhave made it possible for researchers to carry out quantitative studies of various\\nkinds of grammatical frequency, such as the relative frequency of different clause\\ntypes in English.  Other studies use corpora to test predictions made by formal\\ngrammars that have been developed within the generative school of linguistics.
